Credit Scoring Model Implementation
A scoring model to predict the probability of a client's bankruptcy

Introduction
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.
"Prêt à depenser", a French financial company, strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience.
In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, "Prêt à depenser" makes use of a variety of alternative data (including telco and transactional information) to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
While "Prêt à depenser" is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging us to help them unlock the full potential of their data.
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
